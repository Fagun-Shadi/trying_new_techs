Here, I have tried implementing Java programs and various tools like Maven, Junit testing, Rest services using Spring framework.

The folder titled inverse contains the solution to problem statement "Matrix inverse" for a 2*2 and 3*3 matrix.
The Junit testing checks if the determinant of matrix is correct.

The folder digit contains the solution to problem statement - "Convert 4 digit number to string".
Haven't implemented Junit testing function here.
