Here, I have tried implementing Java programs and various tools like Maven, Junit testing, Rest services using Spring framework.

The folder titled try_pal contains the problem statement - "Java Program to Print Smallest and Biggest Possible Palindrome Word in a Given String".
The Junit testing checks if the input string is palindrome.

The folder rem_dupli contains the solution to problem statement - "Remove duplicates from an array".
The Junit testing doesn't check for any related function but it checks if the number matches itself.

The folder titled restful-web-services has a very basic rest implementation using spring framework and maven. 
Implemented till now- GET, POST & DELETE mapping, Exception Handling, HTTP Response statuses.
Implementation left- Validation, HATEOAS, Swagger.
Resource is - Udemy Tutorial "Master Micro Services with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud"
